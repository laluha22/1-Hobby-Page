# 1-Hobby-Page

My hobby page was my first step into HTML. I had zero experience before this. I learnt to create the basic template for a HTML page including head body. Then I learnt to fill out the sections with elements headers, paragraphs and lists.

I decided to display the details of something I find very interesting. - spooky lakes. I must have been influenced by the TikTok creator Geodesaurus who has a series on haunted hydrology, and the fact that it was Halloween at the time of writing this page|

To fulfil the requirements I researched how to add images with alt-text and also how to add links. 

I also figured out how to include css and and java <script> to generate a date in the footer.
